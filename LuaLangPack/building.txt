Building
---------------------
-Install Visual Studio 8 SDK from MS. This version of the source requires the Apr. 2006 RTM version.

-Substitute the location of your SDK installation, including version dir, to your p: drive. 
	Example, >subst p: "D:\Program Files\Visual Studio 2005 SDK\2006.04"

-Open LuaLangPack.sln and rebuild all

**** Note, the MS load key is removed from this source distribution. Therefore, the binaries generated will
 only work on machines with the VS SDK. If you want to distribute a derivitive work that loads without the
 SDK, then you must obtain your own load key from the MS VSIP program. ****


Installing
---------------------
-Install the "Wix" binaries. These can be found on Sourceforge. 

-Run deploy.bat contained in the LuaLangPack project directory. This will invoke Wix to build
 the LuaLangPack.msi and output "ProdDir" and "EnvDir". It will also copy the ProjectAggregator.msi
 form the SDK into the current dir. 

-The parts that need to be deployed are both msi files, EnvDir, ProdDir, and install.bat. Install.bat
 simply runs both msi files. These can all be placed in a self extracting archive or whatever is convinient. 
 Be sure to include the ProjectAggregator.msi, Lua project loading won't work without it.
