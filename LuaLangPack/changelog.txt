Version 0.6.1
---------------------------------------
-Fixed stack overflow crash that occured when assigning a litteral return value from a function
 at a nest level of 1 below the assignment.

-Fixed null ptr exception on multiple local name initialization  



Version 0.6
---------------------------------------
-Added dynamic intellisense support
   -Features
      -Supports member select popup showing all names within lexical scope (see limitations).

      -Supports member selection on tables via DOT operator.

      -Lua 5.0 library functions are hardcoded.
	
   -Limitations
      -Functions with more than one return statement may not display intellisense
       information correctly when return values are referenced in a calling scope.
       Multiple return values, in one return statement, are supported.

      -Assignments within conditionals will not resolve properly. For example,
	
	if x then foo = {n = "n", m = "m"} else foo = {n = "n"} end    
	foo.

	result: either no member popup or one from a previous assignment to foo.

      -Locals declared as part of a 'for' statement will not show in the member popup
       within the 'for' block. There is simply no code is the AST to handle this case yet.
 
      -No function argument tooltip implemented yet

      -Any sort of trickery via metatables is not considered. 

      -Probably much more. This was quite the project, which I greatly underestimated the 
       scope of, and I'm sure I missed plenty. Stay sharp and use the intellisense as a 
       rough guide, not a verification tool.


-Added auto-outlining support on table declarations. 



Version 0.5a (bugfix release)
---------------------------------------
-Added support for lexing/colorizing of block comments.

-Fixed several parser errors that sometimes prevented a full parse. In such cases, 
 auto-outlining would fail. Whether or not you actually hit these errors depended
 greatly on personal coding style.

-Fixed error that caused anonymous functions declared as arguments to function calls 
 from being auto-outlined. 

-All shift-reduce conflicts resolved...although it remains to be seen if they've
 been resolved correctly.

-Fixed syntax highlighting of and, or, not operators.

-Fixed syntax highlighting of single quote strings.

-Added new project file and Lua source file icons donated by Ioannis Kappas.

-Added explicit uninstall of previous version to install bat. Overinstall
 didn't work so a manual uninstall was required before on v0.3. 


Version 0.5
---------------------------------------
-2nd public release.

-Integrated Lua parser.

-Implemented auto code outlining on Lua functions.

-Removed references to old HierarchyWrapper (previous SDK versions) in wix installer.

-Added ProjectAggregator2 msi to install package (required for machines without VS SDK).


Version 0.4
---------------------------------------
-Development release.

-Fixed 'escaped quote within string' syntax highlighting / lexer bug.

-Added Lua 5.1 tokens.


Version 0.3
---------------------------------------
-First public release. Syntax highlighting and Lua project support.
