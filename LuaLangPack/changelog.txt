Version 0.5a (bugfix release)
---------------------------------------
-Added support for lexing/colorizing of block comments.

-Fixed several parser errors that sometimes prevented a full parse. In such cases, 
 auto-outlining would fail. Whether or not you actually hit these errors depended
 greatly on personal coding style.

-Fixed error that caused anonymous functions declared as arguments to function calls 
 from being auto-outlined. 

-All shift-reduce conflicts resolved...although it remains to be seen if they've
 been resolved correctly.

-Fixed syntax highlighting of and, or, not operators.

-Fixed syntax highlighting of single quote strings.

-Added new project file and Lua source file icons donated by Ioannis Kappas.

-Added explicit uninstall of previous version to install bat. Overinstall
 didn't work so a manual uninstall was required before on v0.3. 


Version 0.5
---------------------------------------
-2nd public release.

-Integrated Lua parser.

-Implemented auto code outlining on Lua functions.

-Removed references to old HierarchyWrapper (previous SDK versions) in wix installer.

-Added ProjectAggregator2 msi to install package (required for machines without VS SDK).


Version 0.4
---------------------------------------
-Development release.

-Fixed 'escaped quote within string' syntax highlighting / lexer bug.

-Added Lua 5.1 tokens.


Version 0.3
---------------------------------------
-First public release. Syntax highlighting and Lua project support.
